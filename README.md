This is a simple test while trying to figure out how to use both OpenAI's API and ElevenLabs' API.

Using python's speech_recognition module, the script will first convert speech to text.  That text is then fed along with a prompt to the OpenAI API.

OpenAI's response is then fed into ElevenLabs using a custom voice and the audio file is then ran.  This essentially allows for direct voice communication with OpenAI.
